Please visit the [Readme](https://github.com/twrecked/hass-aarlo/blob/master/README.md) for more details.

# Features

_Aarlo_ is a custom component for [Home  Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), that provides access to  the [Arlo](https://www.arlo.com/en-us/) system.

_Aarlo_ provides, amongst other things:
- Access to cameras, base stations, sirens, doorbells and lights.
- Asynchronous, almost immediate, notification of motion, sound and button press events.
- Ability to view library recordings, take snapshots and direct stream from cameras.
- Tracking of environmental stats from certain base station types.
- Special switches to trip alarms and take snapshots from cameras.
- Enhanced state notifications.
- Media player support for select devices.


There is also a resource
[`aarlo-glance`](https://github.com/twrecked/lovelace-hass-aarlo) which is based on `picture-glance` but tailored for the Arlo component.
